# LinearRegression_HousePricePrediction
### This github repository contains my work for the Module 2 Final Project.
### "For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging. The dataset can be found in the file "kc_house_data.csv", in this repo.
### You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible."
